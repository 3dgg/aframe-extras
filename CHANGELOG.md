# Changelog

## v4.0.0

* Added CHANGELOG.md
* Removed `universal-controls`, replacing with `movement-controls`. In contrast to previous releases, `movement-controls` is intended to be used _with_ the default `look-controls` component. It adds several locomotion methods, and can be extended to include more, replacing `wasd-controls`.
* Added navmesh support to `movement-controls`.
