# Pathfinding

Set of components for pathfinding along a nav mesh, using [PatrolJS](https://github.com/nickjanssen/PatrolJS/).

- **nav-mesh**: Assigns model from the current entity as a [navigation mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh) for the pathfinding system. A navigation mesh is not the same as visible terrain geometry. See below.
- **nav-controller**: Adds behaviors to an entity allowing it to navigate to any reachable destination along the nav mesh.
